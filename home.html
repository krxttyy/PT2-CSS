    <p>In the depths of Philippine seas and rivers lives a legendary being feared and admired for generations—the Sirena.

The Sirena is a mythical sea creature from Philippine mythology, often described as a beautiful woman with the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish. Her enchanting voice and graceful appearance are said to mesmerize sailors and fishermen, drawing them toward the water’s depths. Some legends portray her as gentle and protective of the sea, while others warn that she can be dangerous, luring humans to their doom.

Unlike Western mermaids, the Sirena in local folklore is deeply tied to nature and balance. She is believed to guard marine life and punish those who abuse the ocean. In some stories, Sirenas were once humans cursed or transformed because of broken promises, forbidden love, or divine punishment from higher beings such as Bathala.

Sirenas are also commonly linked with their male counterparts, the Siyokoy, who are often depicted as more monstrous and aggressive. Together, they represent both the beauty and danger of the sea—reminding people to respect nature and its unseen forces.</p>
